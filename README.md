Stage7
======

The goal of Stage7 is to provide an automatic Gentoo Linux install for full size computers. Many install scripts have been made in the past, however none of them have been maintained. Stage7 is an attempt to create an easy to use, continually maintained Gentoo installer.

Why Stage7? In the Bible, the number 7 is the number of fullness, completion, and perfection (Gen 2:2; Ex 21:2; Rev 3:1). In the Gentoo Linux community the term "stage" followed by a number refers to how completed a Gentoo base system is. Stage7 hopes to provide a complete Gentoo Linux system straight off the disk.

How can you help?
* Create some awesome graphics using the text "Stage7" in an artistic way. Check out the fonts in the graphics/fonts folder for some ideas

Soon a full repository will emerge.
