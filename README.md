Stage7
======

The goal of Stage7 is to provide an "automagic" installer for Gentoo-based Linux distrubtions. For now Stage7's installer base full size computers, but in the future support may be added for notebooks. Many automatic install scripts have been made in the past for Gentoo, however none of them have been maintained. Stage7 is an attempt to create an easy to use, continually maintained installer.

Why Stage7? In the Bible, the number 7 is the number of fullness, completion, and perfection (Gen 2:2; Ex 21:2; Rev 3:1). In the Gentoo Linux community the term "stage" followed by a number refers to how completed a Gentoo base system is. Stage7 is a hope to provide a freshly-compiled, completely-configured Gentoo Linux system from the start. You should be able to unattend your Gentoo-based Linux install.

**How do you get Stage7?**

You can download Stage7 by running this command on your favorite Linux distribution:
> wget http://bit.ly/getStage7 getStage7.sh

Make the script executable by running this command:
> chmod +x getStage7.sh


**How do you use Stage7?** 

It's not done yet, so you'll have to wait until then before you can use it.

**What are the advantages of Gentoo-based Linux distributions?**

Actually there's quite a few advantages.
 #Speed. From the core Gentoo Linux is build for speed. It's speedy because it provides the end user with the option to leave out much of the baggage that bloats up other Linux distributions. There is a time trade off, however, because the end user has to compile their own packages.
 #Flexibility. By default Gentoo Linux is arguably the most flexible Linux distribution available to the masses. It is capable of adapting to almost every desktop environment, has thousands of packages in the Portage tree, and has the most frequent releases.

**How can you help?**
* Create some awesome graphics using the text "Stage7" in an artistic way. Check out the fonts in the graphics/fonts folder for some ideas...
* Offer suggestions/feature requests. I'm always open to suggestions.
* Review the code and submit pull requests.


Soon a full repository will emerge.
