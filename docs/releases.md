===Version 0.1.1-alpha===
Started working on adding support for parted. Changed the configuration option to "fpart" to specify calling fdisk.
Started work on adding ntfs and vfat support. FAT is needed for EFI partitions. NTFS would be a nice option to have, so it will be added as well.

===Version 0.1.0-alpha===

This is an alpha release. The software is not very usable 
at this point. We're still in the planning phase.
