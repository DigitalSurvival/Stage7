Ncurser User Interfaces ideas for Stage7.

###X###
For the X server ui there needs to be logical flow to the stage7 configuration tool. At this point I'm thinking of tabs at the top to set the install mode. That would change the body of the form to show only the settings that apply. This tool could generate an install profile for the user.
